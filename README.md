# gifsandvids
A collection of gifs and small vids made by me to be used at other places

Notes:(for futures reference)
1. For importing Latex equations to blender use latex2blender[https://github.com/ghseeli/latex2blender]. While compiling, set X = 90 to import equations in the corret plane.
2. Blender >=2.8 has no option to toggle visibilty. Next best possible soultion is to move the objects in and out of camera view for 2D animations
3. Use Krita[https://krita.org/en/] for creating gifs. If would need ffmpeg which you can download from here[https://ffmpeg.org/download.html]
